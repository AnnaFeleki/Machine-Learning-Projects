## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔍 Classification
This directory includes supervised learning models built to classify categorical outcomes. Examples may include decision trees, random forests, or logistic regression applied to datasets like Iris, Titanic, etc.

### 🖼️ Image Classification
Located under `Image Classification/minst_classification`, this project demonstrates deep learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the popular MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

### 📊 K-Means Clustering
An unsupervised learning project showcasing customer or feature segmentation using the K-Means algorithm. Visualizations included to better understand cluster assignments.

### 📈 Linear Regression
Implementation of linear regression for predictive modeling using real datasets (e.g., Boston Housing), including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (MSE, R²), and scatter plots for interpretation.

### 🎬 Recommendation System
A collaborative filtering-based movie recommendation system using cosine similarity and pandas. Includes a sample UI layer using Flask and data visualization components.
