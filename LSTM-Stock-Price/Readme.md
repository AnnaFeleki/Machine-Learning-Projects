# üìà LSTM Stock Price Forecasting

This project builds a deep learning model to forecast future stock prices using historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data. It uses an LSTM architecture and automatically imports data via the `yfinance` API ‚Äî no manual CSV files required.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Fetches stock price data programmatically with `yfinance`
- Prepares time-series data using windowed sequences and normalization
- Trains a stacked LSTM model for next-step forecasting
- Evaluates model with RMSE, MAE, and directional accuracy
- Generates interactive plots (actual vs. predicted) using Plotly

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

```text
1. Choose your stock ticker (default: AAPL)
2. Automatically download historical stock data (2015‚Äì2024)
3. Normalize and sequence the data for time-series modeling
4. Train an LSTM model on past prices
5. Predict and visualize future prices with performance metrics
